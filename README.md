# Union-Find

This repo contains the code for a verified efficient implementation of a coinductive union-finds.

`UnionFind/FLike.lean` contains the function-like interface that would let you use functions, hashmaps, or even arrays as the internal implementation for the union-find.
`UnionFind/UnionFind.lean` contains the implementation and proofs and theorems about the union-find.

## Efficiency Case Study: WikiLinkGraph

I implemented  a program twice, once in Lean in `Example.lean` and once in rust `example.rs`.
The program consumes a dataset of Wikipedia article connections, a number of connections N, and a list of pairs of articles.
It prints out all the pairs in the latter list which are not mutually reachable in the dataset where only the first N connections are considered.
At its heart is a union-find whose edges are these N connections.
This union-find then encodes the *reachability* equivalence relation.

If you want to see the performance comparison between the best Lean version and the Rust version look no further than `lean_v_rust_benchmark_data.csv`.
To see the performance comparison between the Lean version with hashmaps (the best) and the Lean version with function closures look in `mem_v_fun_benchmark_data.csv`.

To download the dataset run `make enwikigraph2018.tsv`. **BEWARE** this requires at least 10GB of storage and will take some time.

To create a random sample of pairs of articles from the dataset, to use for the case study, you can run `make queries.tsv`. **BEWARE** This only works on Linux (thanks Rust for not providing a RNG in your stdlib).

Finally to recreate or to generate your own benchmark data (if you have GNU parallel installed) you can run
```
make lean_v_rust_benchmark_data.csv
make mem_v_fun_benchmark_data.csv
```

### Manual Trial Test

If you just want to play with it then do the following:
* Create a TSV file `data.tsv` with four headers and each row being a numeric id, an article title, then a numeric id, then an article title.
* Create a TSV file `queries.tsv` without a header and row row is just two titles.
* Run `make` to generate the binaries.
* Run `./example-rs data.tsv 1000 queries.tsv` to check the reachability of the two article in each row of `queries.tsv` using the first 1000 equalities from `data.tsv`.
* Run `./.lake/build/bin/example mem data.tsv 1000 queries.tsv` to do the same using the Lean.

For example `data.tsv` could be
```
id1	title1	id2	title2
9228	Earth	11890785	Summer solstice
12746	Generalization	12157671	Specialisation (biology)
13458	List of historical period drama films and series	1694208	Arturo Perez-Reverte

And `queries.tsv` could be
```
Tintin on postage stamps	5Î²-coprostanol
The Rebel Gladiators	Shorttail Catshark
501c(3)	Kabupaten Sukoharjo
That's Right (album)	1931 Chicago Cardinals football
